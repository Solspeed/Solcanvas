  description:
    "Cubik is an innovative platform designed to revolutionize the way open-source projects are funded and supported. It is crafted with a developer-centric approach, catering to the unique challenges faced by developers while endorsing the power of community participation.\nAt its core, Cubik aims to provide developers the recognition, support, and resources they deserve for bringing their innovative visions to life. This platform aspires to bridge the persisting funding gap in the open-source ecosystem.\nQuadratic Voting\nOne of Cubik's unique features is the incorporation of a fair coordination mechanism known as quadratic voting. In contrast to traditional crowdfunding where the impact is directly proportional to the donation size, quadratic voting allows even a small donation to have a significantly larger influence.\nThis mechanism encourages individuals to donate to projects they genuinely care about, irrespective of their financial capability. It ensures that grant funds, hackathon prize pools, and various resources are distributed in a fair and transparent manner.\nCommunity Involvement\nOn Cubik, the community participates actively in resource distribution.\nDevelopers can create a profile, submit their project, participate in hackathons, and apply for grants within minutes.\nIt also facilitates a decentralized grant round where the community collectively determines the allocation of resources.\nMission\nCubik's mission is to ensure developers receive recognition, support, and resources they need to bring their visions to life, aiming to bridge the funding gap in open-source projects.",
